BigInteger & BigDecimal Classes
	These two classes are essential in Java when you are working with tremendously large numeric values. I have seen the BigInteger class most often used for IDs that are larger than usual. I wouldn't recommend just using these classes instead of the regular integer and BigInteger classes. There are downsides to using the "Big" classes because they store data under the hood differently than Integers. The time to do a simple "Add" between two BigInteger classes will be significantly larger compared to just adding to Integers. 
	More money is in the global financial system. There will be more instances where the BigDecimal class will be needed to handle the size of these potential monetary values. There are other reasons that you could use the BigDecimal Class. That is one example of when it will be needed for everyone.
Calendar & GregorianCalendar Classes
	The Calendar class is the base class from which the GregorianCalendar Class is derived. The Gregorian calendar is supposed to represent the standard calendar most of the world uses today (January, February, March, etc.). The GegorianCalendar class contains quite a few useful functions and built-in Functionality for Developers trying to deal with Dates and Times. For instance, this class will automatically convert January 32nd to February 1st to help you avoid errors. This feature can also be turned off, allowing for Exceptions to be thrown instead.
	As said above, I did come across an article that claims we should use Java. time instead. The GregorianCalendar, while useful, has drawbacks. One of the most significant drawbacks to its use is that it is not thread-safe. You must do extra work to use this class in a multi-threaded environment.
