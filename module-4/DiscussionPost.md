Article Review:
	The article I found and am writing a report on about Java and its current state is actually a yearly report by multiple authors. I am making a summary of Java and its current state. This article is the 7th year the authors have prepared this report.
	One of the most significant points in this article is AI's transformation of how we think about code. In fact, the first bullet point in their summary of the article is about AI. Here is a quote of their bullet point summary of the article: 

	"AI on the JVM accelerates: New frameworks like Embabel, Koog, Spring AI, and LangChain4j drive rapid adoption of AI-native and AI-assisted development in Java." - (Redlich et al., 2025)

	In my opinion, this news is excellent for Java and its future. The article goes on to note that AI is increasingly used to modernize legacy code. At the same time, some people are rightly worried that AI will reduce the headcount of developers in many companies. The time when AI is mature enough to take over all developer jobs completely is far off, and I believe there will always be at least some need for the human touch in programming.
	This hits home for me because the day I wrote this discussion post (1/21), I was part of a meeting discussing how we could use AI to help modernize and convert old VB code to C#. It is exciting because the program we are looking to rewrite has already been "rewritten" in the past (in 2008), and it took 6 dedicated developers 3 years to complete the rewrite. With the use of AI, we are now looking to have 4 semi-dedicated developers rewrite the same application in just under 2 years. It is undoubtedly an aggressive timeline, but it is doable if we use AI correctly and pick and choose our battles strategically.

How is "Open Source" related to the current version of Java?
    The current and most recent versions of Java have been deployed as "Open Source" projects. This means that we, as the public, can view and contribute patches to versions. Doing this allows hundreds, maybe even thousands, of eyes to review every line of code and find vulnerabilities. Leading to more secure, stable, and trusted releases of Java versions. It is interesting to look at the latest versions of Java, because many large companies, like Amazon, have their own versions that are also Open Source.
