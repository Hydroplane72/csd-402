I admittedly know quite a few programming languages, including C#, Java, VB.NET, VB6, VBA, T‑SQL, MySQL, YAML, PowerShell, HTML, and CSS. I also have experience with Oracle DB, C++, JavaScript, React, and Python. With all of that said, I generally use C# for new stuff and maintain code in VB.NET and VB6 on a semi-regular basis. I usually keep myself up to date on other programming languages by using websites like HackerRank to occasionally log in, complete a challenge in a different language, and then continue on.

Beyond languages, I have hands‑on experience creating APIs and testing them with Postman, which has strengthened my ability to design clear, reliable interfaces between systems. I also work extensively with tools and platforms such as NServiceBus, Active Directory, Azure, Azure DevOps, Git, OnBase, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Web Forms, SharePoint, Visual Studio, VS Code, Beyond Compare, Access, Excel, and Notepad++. Because of my broad experience across many areas, I can pick the best option for the job rather than being stuck in the "what I know" category very often.

In my current role, I serve as a subject-matter expert across several significant areas of our organization’s data model. I’m frequently consulted to help architect solutions that are both maintainable and scalable. One example of this was my role in helping pave the way for other teams through the conversion from TFVC to Git. As part of that effort, I created reusable YAML templates that are easy for teams to adopt and flexible enough to handle nearly all of our build and deployment scenarios. This experience reinforced my commitment to building solutions that others can build on, extend, and maintain.

I’m always thinking about how existing processes could be streamlined, and I’m comfortable weighing the return on investment of improving what we have versus starting fresh. That balance between practicality and innovation helps ensure that the solutions brought forth are usable for years future. I like to code in ways that even if the code base isn't opened up for many years. The amount of time a developer will need to spend on it is hopefully minimal.

On the personal side, I value clarity, reliability, and teamwork. I enjoy breaking down complex problems, understanding how systems fit together, and helping others do the same. I’m adaptable when learning new technologies, patient when troubleshooting, and committed to producing work that others can rely on.
